# elm-rest-json-example

* Simple example of how to use REST API with Elm. 
* Using [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as API.
* Using [Json.Decode.Pipeline](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest/Json.Decode.Pipeline)
  * With just Json.Decode, check [vanilla_decode](https://github.com/skipadu/elm-rest-json-example/blob/vanilla_decode/src/RestJson.elm) branch


## Why?

* Using JSON with Elm is a little tricky with all those decoders.
* This repo shows how to use decoders inside decoders.
* For learning purpose and hopefully helping others.
